# Neural Network Go Library

## What is this? 
A library written using Go. The library allows users to create a neural network with a configurable number of neurons and layers.\
The library also implements backpropgation using gradient descent to gradually reduce the cost function.

## Why I did this
A feeling of wanting to learn how to use Go, and understand more about the intuition about neural networks.

## Future Plans/Improvements
I plan to add some optimisers, to make it faster \
Furthermore, I plan on augmenting it to make it a convolutional neural network. However, I might redo the project in Rust instead for that.\
